# Java Overview

**Java** is a general-purpose, high-level, object-oriented programming language. It was developed by **James Gosling** at **Sun Microsystems** in **1995**.

## Principles of Java (Goals)

1. It must be **simple**, **object-oriented**, and **familiar**.  
2. It must be **robust** and **secure**.  
3. It must be **architecture-neutral** and **portable**.  
4. It must execute with **high performance**.  
5. It must be **interpreted**, **threaded**, and **dynamic**.

## Why is Java So Popular?

- **Platform Independent**  
- **Fundamentally Object-Oriented**  
- **Easy to Learn**  
- **Versatile**

## Use Cases of Java

1. Building **Android applications**  
2. Developing **Java-based web applications**  
3. Creating **software tools**  
4. Designing **scientific applications**  
5. And many more use cases...

## ğŸ’¡ How Java Code Works

When you write Java code, the following steps take place during execution:

1. **Compilation**:  
   The Java compiler (`javac`) compiles the `.java` source file into **bytecode**, which is stored in a `.class` file.

2. **Bytecode Generation**:  
   The compiled bytecode is a platform-independent code that can run on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

3. **Execution via JVM**:  
   The **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** interprets or just-in-time compiles the bytecode and executes it on the host machine.

4. **Output**:  
   The program runs and produces output on your console or GUI depending on your code.

> ğŸ“Œ This architecture makes Java **platform-independent**, meaning you can write code once and run it anywhere with a JVM.
